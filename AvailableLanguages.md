By default, SolrMeter takes your default locale to choose the language. If you don't want this and you want to set the language yourself, you can change the properties:

```
view.locale.language=en
view.locale.country=US
```

If you would like to translate SolrMeter, just open the messages.properties file and translate all the values to whatever language you want. Thanks to all contributors!
