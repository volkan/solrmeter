Standalone java tool for stress testing over Solr.

## In more than one sentence ##
The main goal of this open source project is bring to the solr user community a "generic tool to interact specifically with solr", firing queries and adding documents to make sure that your Solr implementation will support the real use.
With SolrMeter you can simulate your work load over solr index and retrieve statistics graphically.

## Java WebStart ##
